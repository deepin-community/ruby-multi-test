Description: library to control autorun feature of test frameworks
 This library provides a uniform interface onto whatever testing library has
 been loaded into a running Ruby process. It can be used for example to
 deactivate the autorun feature of those testing frameworks in a unified way.
 Supported test frameworks are RSpec, test/unit, and minitest.
 .
 It is used to run the test suite of the cucumber package.
